Hello! My name is Simran and I'm a recent [Geography–Data Science](https://geography.washington.edu/ba-geography-data-science-option) graduate from the University of Washington. I specialized in multiple programs within GIS and data science like R, QGIS, ArcGIS Online, and Web GIS. 


Here I have GIS Projects I have done during my time at the University of Washington. 

## Arc GIS Online Story Maps:


### ArcGIS Online Story Map on Partition of Brtish India

## Web GIS:

### Tracking Carbon Emissions in Europe

- Built with HTML, JavaScript, and SQL.
- Interactive time slider, emissions intensity gradients, and popups.
- Designed for public and policymaker engagement.

## ArcGIS Pro

### Drinking Water Systems and Buffer Zones – Snohomish County, WA
- Created in ArcGIS Pro using public data from the [Washington Department of Health](https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WADOH::drinking-water-systems/explore)
- Mapped drinking water systems across Snohomish County and applied a 500-meter buffer analysis.
- Styled water systems by operational status (active, inactive) using unique symbology.
- Designed a professional layout with legend, scale bar, north arrow, and descriptive text.

This project explores how proximity analysis and cartographic design can support environmental planning and water resource management. It highlights areas potentially sensitive to nutrient runoff and land use impacts, and demonstrates spatial filtering, symbology, and layout design in ArcGIS Pro.

## QGis

### Mapping Climate Change with QGIS


- Compared historical vs. projected temperatures data across the U.S.
- Used raster datasets, interpolation, and custom symbology.
- Designed inset maps to highlight regional climate impacts.

## Python

###  Ferry Ridership Flow Visualization 

- Processed WSDOT data to create a Sankey diagram.
- Analyzed ridership trends and flow patterns.

In this project, our group created a Sankey diagram to visualize ferry ridership flows across the Puget Sound region using 2023 data from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The objective was to explore how spatial data can tell stories about movement and connection. We focused on routes within the Washington State Ferries system, the largest ferry system in the U.S., and transformed raw ridership numbers into a more intuitive visual format.


This project focuses on the Seattle metropolitan area and surrounding waters, where ferries are a central part of daily transportation. The Washington State Ferries system includes 13 key routes that connect cities and islands across the Puget Sound.

The Sankey diagram presents ferry routes as flows, with origin points on the left and destination points on the right. The width of each flow corresponds to the total number of passengers, allowing for an immediate visual comparison between routes.

We used three variables:

- Source: Ferry terminal of departure
- Target: Destination terminal
- Value: Number of riders

Data collected from: Washington State Ferries Traffic Statistics Rider Segment Report
